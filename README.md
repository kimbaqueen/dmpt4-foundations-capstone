# bookList App

Welcome to my DevMountain Foundations Capstone! 

For my project, I created an app that organizes industry book recommendations. User is able to filter recommended books by category and also add new books to the recommended list as features. 

# Tech Stack

My app is primarily built with vanilla Javascript. I did create my own database and included SQL in addition to JS. Also custom created the Logo, color scheme, and front end styling. 

# Methodology

For my database, I wanted to keep it simple yet effective. Using SQL for the data pulls & Javascript to code a dynamic web page, I created a grid gallery that is linked directly with my database. It is interactive and automatically updates the front end display with any new bookList entries added. 

I did run into some challenges in coding some of the loop functions on the sort A-Z feature. I found myself overcomplicating the code with Javascript, but found an alternative DRY method using Sequelize instead. When I understood the logic behind it and how effective it was, that was a major win. 

The most interesting part for me was when the database was connected with my front end. That was such a game changer for me to visually see the code doing what it's supposed to do, and getting to finally stylize it! There was complexity in this because of the additional backend and server connections that were needed, but the payoff was worth it!

I learned so much during foundations at DevMountain and I'm so excited to continue onto Specializations to learn more on Data Analytics and add to my skill set!
